        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hey there, fellow explorers of the digital realm! I'm that friendly face behind the 
            screen – a fourth-year computer science student at Griffith College who moonlights 
            as a budding software engineer. If you're thinking "tech enthusiast with a dash of 
            curiosity," you've got me pegged!
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not busy juggling textbooks and code, you'll find me in a world of my own creation
            – crafting 2D PC games that burst with imagination and wonder. Unity engine and Blender are 
            my trusty sidekicks in this journey, helping me shape digital dreams into playable realities. 
            There's just something magical about bringing pixels to life, don't you think?
        </p>
        <p>
            As I wade through the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, one thing's for sure: 
            I've got an insatiable hunger to learn, grow, and expand my horizons. Fullstack development 
            has me completely starry-eyed – the idea of creating something from the front-end dazzle to 
            the back-end magic just resonates with me.
        </p>
